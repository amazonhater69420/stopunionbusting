Did you see about the Google Union?
As you know, the Alphabet conglomerate has a reputation for being a bit cheap. Every now and then, the unions come together to push for better working conditions for their workers. Most of these initiatives are unsuccessful but occasionally a fight is won. The only serious change that I know of so far has been an eight-hour day. Google workers came together at lunchtime today for a rally against overworking and unhealthy working conditions at Google.
