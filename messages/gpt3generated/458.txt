Will I need to pay union dues if I want to belong to this club?
What if the union falls? What if a Republican becomes president? Even if these things do not happen, if I give up on trying to stop these things from happening, am I still entitled to a share of the gains they produce? Or, am I entitled to none of it? The New Testament tells us of a time when the promise of the resurrection was not true. The chief priests and scribes had bought and sold Jesus to the highest bidder. He was not a Messiah they could depend on.
