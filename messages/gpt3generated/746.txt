I love working at an amazon warehouse, but with the holidays coming up, I've been working a lot and its probably time to take a break.
Well, to quote my nephew Logan, "I really need to get a life." So, I am taking my life, or my non - existent life, and creating one. I am joining the Amazon wish list service so I can earn a little money towards my holiday shopping. The options include to be the kind of person who pays for others shipping costs, pay for their own shipping costs, or even donate and earn a credit in return.
