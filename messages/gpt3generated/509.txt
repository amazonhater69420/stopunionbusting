Hello, I'm concerned about some labor organizing I've seen in the warehouse.
I see that they have a very stringent time card system, where they dictate when and how many hours an employee can work. This scares me for several reasons. First of all, I don't know how well I'd be able to meet that time card system, let alone the pressure of potentially being fired for doing so. Secondly, the fact that they hold the time card system above everything else in the store concerns me. They have also established a uniform in my store that gives out points on the time card
