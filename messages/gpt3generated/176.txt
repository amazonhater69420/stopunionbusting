Who is starting the union at amazon?
Joan (from Appletree) runs a team of just five that works on app build system AMS. Joe (from Local Global) runs a team of 80 that builds apps for the Appletree Open Cloud Operating System. They all work in Amazon's corporate headquarters in Seattle. Today's meeting started with an inspirational talk about the history of Local Global's work on Appletree, followed by introductions, a short networking period, then the regular meeting.
