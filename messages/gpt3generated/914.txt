What will Amazon do with our warehouse if we unionize?
We still worry about what Amazon might do. We’ve had—over the years, we have had members whose identities were stolen from a file cabinet, with all their work history. And we’ve had union members who have had to go to court and prove that they are not union supporters, because they were fired for that. So, I mean, we have people whose careers have been destroyed by Amazon in this country. So, you know, we worry about what will happen, but we’ve been trying to organize there.
