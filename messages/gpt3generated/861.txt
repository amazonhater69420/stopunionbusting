I've seen a lot of workers meeting after work, drinking too much, and sometimes being mean to each other.
I've also seen too many families who don't have enough to eat. That just makes me sad for everyone. But this new policy just about kills me. While I want everyone to have a good working environment and good benefits, this is taking it a step too far. I think they are overreacting. All it would take is posting a policy that your employees aren't allowed to drink alcohol after work, or drink for hours on end.
