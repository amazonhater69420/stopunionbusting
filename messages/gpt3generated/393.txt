Yesterday I got a union pamphlet in the mail.
It went something like this: Hello, My name is Gail Andris, and I am your union steward. My job is to help you learn about the union and all that we do. I am your voice in the union, and my job is to make sure you get what you deserve! Please help me to do this by showing up at your medical appointments! In return, I will be giving you a little gift, as a token of my gratitude! Did I get nothing from the quote? Did it even go on to explain what the gift was? No, I didn't.
