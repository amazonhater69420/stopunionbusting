I'm concerned that the union authorization card that they are giving us, will have the full weight of the California courts behind it and it will be hard to recover from any wrong doing.
I'd like to be able to believe that one, but the class action suits that have recently come out against Kodak would be very hard for an employer like BAE to fight. I just hate the fact that I was so happy with this place, only to find out I'm not so happy with it after all. When you look up the definition of the word "heart," you get a whole new meaning.
