Waluigi is a man seen only in mirror images; lost in a hall of mirrors, he is a reflection of a reflection of a reflection.

You start with Mario—the wholesome all Italian plumbing superman, you reflect him to create Luigi—the same thing but slightly less. You invert Mario to create Wario—Mario turned septic and libertarian—then you reflect the inversion in the reflection: you create a being who can only exist in reference to others.

Waluigi is the true nowhere man, without the other characters he reflects, inverts and parodies he has no reason to exist. Waluigi’s identity only comes from what and who he isn’t—without a wider frame of reference he is nothing. He is not his own man.

In a capitalist world where our identities are shaped by parasocial relationships to brands and consumption, we are all just as devoid as Waluigi.
