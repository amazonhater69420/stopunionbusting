I bought this flag online a couple months ago, thinking “hey i need a red flag”

The product page said “one hundred and fifty centimeter x ninety one centimeter” so I said out loud “yes this looks good to me” and clicked the button. a kind and overworked delivery driver then arrived at my house with my order and upon opening the parcel i was instantly overwhelmed with the gigantic size of this red flag. what the fuck. i remember using centimeters in school and they were like real small. one corner of this immense square of fabric instantly hit me in the eye and got me blinded for like twelve seconds. this flag is literally to big to be handled and i folded it back as soon as i could get a grip over its massive reach. it is now sitting in a drawer of my room my mom asked me “hey what’s that you ordered? im curious ; is it my christmas present :)” shut up mo m you have zero idea how serious this is i live in fear. i can feel the spectre of communism howling my name at night, and in my dreams Vladimir Ulyanov torments me, he calls me a либеральный a shames me for owning a funkopop
